# NOTE: This workflow must be kept in sync with the 'lint-python' target in the root Makefile.
#       The Makefile target performs the same checks locally. When adding or modifying
#       Python linting configuration, update both this workflow and the Makefile to ensure consistency.
#       The workflow runs: make lint-python
