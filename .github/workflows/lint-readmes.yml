# NOTE: This workflow must be kept in sync with the 'lint-readmes' target in the root Makefile.
#       The Makefile target performs the same checks locally. When adding or modifying
#       README linting, update both this workflow and the Makefile to ensure consistency.
#       The workflow runs: make lint-readmes
